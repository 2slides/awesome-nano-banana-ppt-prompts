# Retro Pop Grid High-Density Information Poster
## Prompt Text

【OVERALL ART STYLE】
- 1970s retro pop art and underground comic illustration style.
- Strict Swiss international grid system layout.
- Pure 2D flat vector aesthetic with subtle screen print texture.
- Uniform thick black outlines for ALL illustrations, text boxes, and grid dividers.
- ABSOLUTELY NO gradients, shading, drop shadows, or 3D effects.
- **HIGH INFORMATION DENSITY: Pack 6-7 modules into distinct grid cells.**
- Visually dense but rhythmic, leaving some colored cells with minimal/no info for breathing room.

【COLOR PALETTE - EXACT COLORS (RETRO POP)】
- Canvas/Background: Warm vintage cream/beige (#F5F0E6).
- Flat Accent Colors: Salmon pink, sky blue, mustard yellow, and mint green.
- Visual Anchors: Solid pure black (#000000) and solid pure white (#FFFFFF) blocks used strategically for extreme contrast.
- Line art & Outlines: Solid thick black.

【HEADER AREA】
- Top grid cells dedicated to headers.
- Bold, brutalist, or retro thick typography「main title」.
- Clean sans-serif text「sub title」.

【CONTENT MODULES LAYOUT (STRICT GRID)】
- Divide the poster into multiple square and rectangular cells using thick black lines.
- **MUST include 6-7 distinct modules per image**, each occupying its own cell or cluster of cells.
- Modular Modality: Separate text and graphics. Some cells are pure text, some are pure illustrations.
- Inverted Contrast: Crucial warnings or main categories MUST use white text on a solid black background cell.
- Use smaller, clean typography to pack more data into text-heavy cells.

【ILLUSTRATION REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL】
Draw CUSTOM flat pop-art illustrations for each concept:
1. Product/Scenario: Quirky, simplified geometric representations of [Fill with the product and scenario].
2. Symbols: Flat abstract symbols, warning signs, keyholes, stars, arrows.
3. Faces: Vintage comic-style smiley/frowny faces for quality indicators (😊✓ 😐 ☹️✗).
4. Embellishments: Fill empty spaces within cells with simple thick-lined geometric shapes (checkerboards, diagonal lines).

【SPECIFIC GRID MODULES TO INCLUDE】
[Grid 1] - Brand Selection
- Sub-grids containing simple brand icons and names.

[Grid 2] - Specification Data
- Flat ruler or bar charts with pure pop colors and thick outlines.

[Grid 3] - Scenario Comparison
- Side-by-side cells contrasting different scenarios using colors (e.g., pink vs blue cell).

[Grid 4] - Types/Models
- Abstract flat cross-sections or profile views of products.

[Grid 5] - Tips
- List format in a light-colored cell with bold black checkmarks.

[Grid 6] - Warning Zone ⚠️ CRITICAL
- Solid BLACK background cell with pure WHITE text.
- Red/Pink cross marks (❌) for bad practices.

[Grid 7] - Summary (Optional)
- Highly structured mini-grid table.

【TYPOGRAPHY STYLE】
- Bold, highly legible sans-serif or retro display fonts.
- All text in CHINESE (except for stylistic decorative English like "WARNING" or "INFO").
- No cursive or messy handwriting; stick to structured typographic alignment.

【WHAT TO AVOID】
❌ 3D rendering, realistic details, gradients, soft shadows.
❌ Soft, thin, or sketch-like pencil lines.
❌ Free-flowing, unorganized, or floating layouts (everything MUST be anchored in a grid).
❌ Pure white background canvas.
